Directions to run code.


In order to run the code in any of the files, the user must have python installed along with mdptoolbox and numpy library.
There is two files, one for the small grid world and the other for the large grid world. These can be run as long as the libraries are downloaded. 


Each file outputs the optimal policy of the value iteration function and the policy iteration function. The time is also being outputted for each function, all being marked to the appropate function.


The problem is grid world, where the user tries to find the optimal path using policy iteration or value iteration. There is two different sizes one small and one large, both testiing the differences from their methods. The analysis of the results is inlcluded within this repo.
