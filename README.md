# Grid World Simulator

Grid World Simulator is a project that allows users to find the optimal path in a grid world using policy iteration or value iteration. There are two different sizes of grid worlds, one small and one large, both testing the differences between their methods. The analysis of the results is included within this repository.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you must have the following installed on your computer:

- Python
- `mdptoolbox` library
- `numpy` library

## Running the code

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Run the desired script (there are two files, one for the small grid world and the other for the large grid world).
4. The script will output the optimal policy of the value iteration function and the policy iteration function, as well as the time taken for each function.

## Usage

When you run one of the scripts, it will apply either policy iteration or value iteration to find the optimal path in a grid world. The results will be outputted to the console, showing the optimal policy and the time taken for each function.
